# House-Price-Prediction

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle to predict house prices based on various features like size, location, BHK , and more. Using machine learning techniques, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices accurately. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, with the goal of creating a valuable tool for real estate pricing.


## Roadmap

- **Data Collection:** Ensure you have a diverse and comprehensive dataset. It should include features like house size, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, year built, neighborhood information, and historical sales data.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers. Also, convert categorical data into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding.

- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones that might have a significant impact on house prices. For example, you can calculate the price per square foot, create age-related features, or extract information from textual descriptions.

- **Data Visualization:** Use data visualization tools to gain insights into your dataset. Visualizations can help you understand the relationships between features and the target variable (house prices). This step can also help you identify outliers or patterns.

- **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression, as house price prediction is essentially a regression problem. Common choices include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

- **Model Training:** Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Train your chosen machine learning models on the training data and evaluate their performance on the testing data.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the hyperparameters of your models to achieve the best performance. You can use techniques like grid search or randomized search.

- **Develop and Train the Model:** Build and train your machine learning model using Python. Save the trained model to a file.

- **Create a Flask Web API:** Develop a Flask web application, define API endpoints for prediction, load the trained model, and use Postman to send requests to the deployed API for predictions.
